# Redis-TinyURL

## Installation

install all python requirements :

```
$ pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```

## How to run

After making sure your redis server is running, you can start the program :

```
$ python main.py [host] [port]
```

By default, the host is <b>localhost</b> and the port is <b>6379</b>. Both arguments are thus optional.

## How to use

1. Start by login using your email address (if you're a new user, an account with your email address will be created).
2. You can then convert your ulr from long to short or vice versa.
3. The button <b>Dump stats user</b> allows you to see statistics of your account. They will be printed on your terminal and saved in the file `stats.txt`
